It can move up to Spelljamming Speed (100 million miles in 24 hours) in Wildspace or the Astral Sea, or up to 10 mph while objects weighing 1 ton or more are within 1 mile of it. All matter within 500 feet of the device moves with it. The Spelljamming Mythallar and all structures held aloft by it hover in place when not in motion.",
						"As an action, you can cause one magic item you are holding within 30 feet of the Spelljamming Mythallar to immediately regain all its expended charges or uses. A magic item recharged in this manner can't be recharged by the Spelljamming Mythallar again until after the item regains expended charges or uses on its own.",
						"You can use the Spelljamming Mythallar to cast the {@spell dream of the blue veil|tce} provided you have the material components. The creature limit is lifted and instead uses the area controlled by the mythallar. This property can be used 1 time per day, or after the mythallar has been fueled by a magic item (up to DM Discretion).",
						"Any creature that touches the globe of the mythallar must make a DC 30 Constitution saving throw, taking {@damage 30d10 + 100} force damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Any object that touches the globe, other than some artifacts or the mythallar's cradle, is disintegrated instantly (no save)."
