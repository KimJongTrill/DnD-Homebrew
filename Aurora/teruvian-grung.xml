			<p>Grungs are aggressive froglike humanoids found in rain forests and tropical jungles. They are fiercely territorial and see themselves as superior to most other creatures.</p>
			<h4>TREE-DWELLING AMPHIBIANS</h4>
			<p>Grungs live in trees and prefer shade. A grung hatchery is maintained in wellguarded ground-level pools. About three months after hatching, a grung tadpole takes on the shape of an adult. It takes another six to nine months for a grung juvenile to reach maturity.</p>
			<h4>GRUNG TRAITS</h4>
			<p>Your grung character has an assortment of inborn abilities, part and parcel of grung nature.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Ability Score Increase.</em></strong> Your Dexterity score increases by 2 and your Constitution score increases by 1.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Age.</em></strong> Grungs age as most of the humanoids in Teruvia do, with them living to 80 to 100 years old in some cases.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Size.</em></strong> Grungs stand between 2 ½ and 3 ½ feet tall and average about 30 pounds. Your size is Small.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Speed.</em></strong> Your base walking speed is 25 feet, and you have a climbing speed of 25 feet.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Arboreal Alertness.</em></strong> You have proficiency in the Perception skill.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Amphibious.</em></strong> You can breathe air and water.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Toxic by Nature.</em></strong> You’re resistant to poison damage and immune to the poisoned condition.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Poisonous Skin.</em></strong> For one turn any creature that grapples you or otherwise comes into direct contact with your skin must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned for 1 minute. A poisoned creature no longer in direct contact with you can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.</p>
			<p class="indent">You can also apply this poison to any piercing weapon as part of an attack with that weapon, though when you hit the poison reacts differently. The target must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or take 2d4 poison damage.</p>
			<p class="indent">You can use your Poisonous Skin a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p>

			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Languages.</em></strong> You can speak, read, and write Grung and Common.</p>
