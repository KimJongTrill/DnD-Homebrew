			<p>You have learned to weave shadow magic into your illusions to give them a semi-reality. When you cast an Illusion spell with a spell slot, you can choose one inanimate, nonmagical object that is part of the illusion and make that object real. You can do this on your turn as a Bonus Action while the spell is ongoing. The object remains real for 1 minute, during which it can't deal damage or give any conditions. For example, you can create an illusion of a bridge over a chasm and then make it real and cross it.</p>
