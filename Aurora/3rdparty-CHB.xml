		<description>
			<p>These dark leather boots look to be of common make, but a subtle pattern of swirling storm clouds upon their soles suggests the potency of their enchantment. You can activate these boots as part of your movement, gaining the following benefits until the end of your turn:</p>
			<p class="indent">You have a flying speed of 90 feet.</p>
			<p class="indent">Opportunity attacks against you are made with disadvantage.</p>
			<p class="indent">Whenever you move within 5 feet of a hostile creature, it must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 3d8 lightning damage. A creature can’t be damaged in this way more than once per turn.</p>
			<p class="indent">Once  this property is used, it can’t be used again until the next dawn.</p>

	<element name="Amulet of Equilibrium" type="Magic Item" source="Third Party Curated Homebrew" id="ID_CHB_TGS_AMULET_EQUILIBRIUM">
		<description>
			<p>This spiraling pendant is made of three magic-sensitive panes of colorful crystal. Each piece of crystal is attuned to a different arcane element. If you can cast spells, you can use the amulet as a spellcasting focus while you're attuned to it.</p>
			<p>The amulet has 4 charges and regains 2 expended charges daily at dawn. When you deal cold, fire, or lightning damage to a single creature while wearing the amulet, you can expend any number of its charges to reroll that many of the cold, fire, or lightning damage dice. You must use the new rolls. Whenever you take cold, fire, or lightning damage from a hostile creature, the amulet regains 1 charge.</p>

			<p>If a Large or smaller creature hits you with a melee attack while you're wearing this cloak, you can use your reaction to cause time to briefly warp around you. After taking the damage from the attack, you can immediately move up to half your speed without provoking opportunity attacks, and the attacker's speed is reduced to 0 until the end of this turn. Once this property of the cloak has been used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.</p>

		<description>
			<p>These robes are unique to the wearer and are spun from special, magic-sensitive threads. While wearing these robes, you gain an additional way to calculate your AC. Your AC equals 10 + your spellcasting ability modifier. Whenever you cast a spell of first level or higher, you can also change the apparent style, color, and apparent material of the robe. Regardless of its appearance, it is always a robe and its weight remains the same. Glowing, arcane glyphs appear on the robe's fabric when you cast a spell before fading away a moment later.</p>
