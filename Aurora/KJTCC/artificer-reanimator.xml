			<p>Using Tinker's Tools or another type of Artisan's Tools with which you have proficiency, you can take a Magic action to create a Reanimated Companion through the power of necromancy and science. The companion manifests in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of you. You determine the companion's appearance; your choices don't affect the companion's game statistics.</p>
			<p class="indent">In combat, the companion acts during your turn. It can move and take its Reaction on its own, but the only action it takes is the Dodge action unless you take a Bonus Action to command it to take an action. If you have the Incapacitated condition, the companion acts on its own and isn't limited to the Dodge action.</p>
			<p class="indent">The companion is Friendly to you and your allies and obeys you. It lasts until you finish a Long Rest or until you take a Magic action to dismiss it early, at which point it harmlessly collapses into a pile of viscera. It immediately drops to 0 Hit Points and dies (triggering its Death Burst trait) if you die.</p>
			<p class="indent">Once you create a companion, you can't do so again until you finish a Long Rest or expend a spell slot to create one. You can have only one companion at a time and can't create one while your companion is present.</p>
