			<p class="flavor">Punish Evildoers at Any Cost</p>
			<p>The Oath of Vengeance is a solemn commitment to punish those who have committed grievously evil acts. When evil armies slaughter helpless villagers, when a tyrant defies the will of the gods, when a thieves' guild grows too violent, when a dragon rampages through the countryside — at times like these, paladins arise and swear an Oath of Vengeance to set right what has gone wrong.</p>
			<p class="indent">These paladins share the following tenets:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Show the wicked no mercy.</li>
				<li>Fight injustice and its causes.</li>
				<li>Aid those harmed by injustice.</li>
			</ul>
